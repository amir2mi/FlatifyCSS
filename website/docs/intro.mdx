FlatifyCSS is the web modern and minimalist flat design library for clever and stylish developers, inspired by [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) design system.

When we talk about flat design, you might think about the creepy palette and some old-fashioned web trends, but no, flat design is a wide term and in this case for FlatifyCSS, there are some principles that shape it clearly:

1- No blurred shadow
2- Borders are cool
3- Round but not much

FlatifyCSS respects accessibility and good practices are provided to acknowledge that "the web is for everyone".
