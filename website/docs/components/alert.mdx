Alerts are a great way to communicate with users, to show errors, warnings, tips, and much more ideas
an alert can be helpful. Alerts can be dismissable so if users do not want to see them again they can close it.

### A simple alert

Any HTML tag can be alert with `.alert` class,
however, a `<div>` with paragraphs in it is the most common choice.

<PreviewBox
	height="150px"
	children='
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githack.com/amir2mi/FlatifyCSS/master/dist/css/flatify-min.css" />
		<title>Buttons</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="flex-center" style="flex-wrap: wrap">
    		<div class="alert">
                I am an alert to notify you of how great you are.
            </div>
    	</div>
    </body>

</html>
'
/>

```html title="index.html"
<div class="alert">  
    I am an alert to notify you of how great you are.  
</div>
```
