import PreviewBox from "../../src/components/preview-box";

With Tabs we can have different layers of content in the same place, users can choose which layer they want to see. To use tabs, it is necessary to load the JavaScript file of FlatifyCSS, so without this file, you just have the component which does not work on click.

## A simple tabs component

Each tabs component is wrapped with `.tabs-wrapper` (which is not necessary), there is a header and content area. Inside the header area buttons are represented, they have target tab panel selectors that are inside the content area.

:::info Accessibility matters!
Try to apply guides for a perfect tab component, first read [W3C Working Groups Notes about tabs](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel). The code of the example above has done the things that you should do, for example, the active tab button will get `aria-selected="true"` automatically, you just need to determine the basics `aria-` HTML attributes.
:::

```html title="index.html"
<div class="tabs-wrapper">
	<div class="tabs-header" role="tablist">
		<button role="tab" class="tab-button active" aria-controls="panel-kafka" aria-selected="true">Kafka</button>
		<button role="tab" class="tab-button" aria-controls="panel-werther" aria-selected="false">Werther</button>
		<button
			role="tab"
			class="tab-button"
			aria-controls="panel-cicero"
			data-tab-target=".cicero-tab-panel"
			aria-selected="false"
		>
			Cicero
		</button>
	</div>
	<div class="tabs-content">
		<div id="panel-kafka" class="tab-panel show">1 ...</div>
		<div id="panel-werther" class="tab-panel">2 ...</div>
		<div id="panel-cicero" class="tab-panel cicero-tab-panel">3 ...</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

:::info Determine the target panel
A tab button should determine the target tab panel that will be displayed when the tab button is clicked.  
It can be defined with both `data-tab-target` and `aria-controls` HTML attributes.  
Note that `data-tab-target` has more priority and it accepts any kind of selectors like `data-tab-target=".my-panel"` so you should determine if the selector is class or ID.  
On the other hand, `aria-controls="my-panel"` is an HTML attribute for accessibility purposes it should have the ID of the target panel so it can be used to determine the target as well (when `data-tab-target` is not set).
:::

## Animations

Tabs by default has blow in/out animation, however you can add `.slide-animation`, `.fade-animation`, `.no-animation` to `.tabs-content`.  
By the way, it is possible to use a brand new animation to show/hide tabs, you can use CSS variables — that are defined for this purpose — to create your gorgeous animation.

### Predefined animations

`.slide-animation`  
`.fade-animation`  
`.no-animation`  

### Custom animations

To change current animations duration:  
`--flatify__tab-animation-show-duration`  
`--flatify__tab-animation-hide-duration`

Or set custom animations:  
`--flatify__tab-animation-show`  
`--flatify__tab-animation-hide`

:::danger Do not use `none` for animations!
Never use `none` for these kinds of animations, because FlatifyCSS JavaScript listens to [animationend event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/animationend_event), so if you set `none` there won't be an animation, it means `animationend` is not going to be triggered. If you want to disable an animation just set `animation-duration` to `0s`.

To change tabs size use [size setter classes](/docs/helpers/size-setters).
These classes just set a `font-size` property so it is possible to change it yourself by writing custom CSS.

## Colors

There are helper classes for styling elements like tabs, first read about [color setter classes](/docs/helpers/color-setters). Note that you should add classes to the `.tabs-wrapper` or `.tabs-header` and `.tabs-content` separately.

## Customization

FlatifyCSS has some CSS variables for customizing tabs, as we talked earlier about animations you can also change the colors of tabs with these variables.

`--flatify__tab-txt-color`  
`--flatify__tab-bg-color`  
`--flatify__tab-border-color`  
`--flatify__color-accent-primary` (to customize active tab color)

and also animation CSS variables as [we talked about them above](#animations):

`--flatify__tab-animation-show-duration`  
`--flatify__tab-animation-hide-duration`  
`--flatify__tab-animation-show`  
`--flatify__tab-animation-hide`
