title: Dark mode
sidebar_position: 8.5

If you use Sass to develop, there is a predefined placeholder selector for dark mode, this file is in `/scss/helpers/_dark-mode.scss`, in this file the `%dark-mode` selector is defined you can create your selectors by extending it.  
Here is an example of a dark mode selector:

```scss title="style.scss"
html.dark {
  @extend %dark-mode;
}
```

or you can detect automatically if users prefer dark theme with [CSS `@media` feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme):

```scss title="style.scss"
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    @extend %dark-mode;
  }
}
```

Now if the `<html>` tag has the `.dark` class or the user prefers to have a dark theme, the dark mode will be applied.  
Note that you should extend this selector as `<html>` tag because it changes CSS variables that are defined as the `:root`.
