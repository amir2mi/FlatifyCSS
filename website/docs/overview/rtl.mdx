title: Right to left
---

FlatifyCSS supports the right to left languages, we provide files with the `-rtl` suffix. on [development page](/docs/overview/development) we have disgusted how files are compiled. if you run `gulp` or `gulp release` you will get the RTL files, **however `gulp watch` does not compile files to RTL**.

There is a file called `flatify-rtl.scss` it is just the main file but `$IS_LTR` is set to `FALSE` so we will get the RTL version of the files.

With Sass we decide values based on the `$IS_LTR` variable, for example:

```scss
body {
	@if $IS_LTR {
		direction: ltr;
	} @else {
		direction: rtl;
	}
}
```

The snippet above will be compiled to (Left to right):

```css
body {
	direction: ltr;
}
```

and for (Right to left):

```css
body {
	direction: rtl;
}
```

So you can extend features for both LTR and RTL with this condition easily.
