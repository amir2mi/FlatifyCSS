FlatifyCSS comes with some helper mixins to make your website responsive, if you use Sass in this case these mixins simplify the process of writing [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

## Responsive breakpoints

First read about [customization](/docs/overview/customization). Responsive breakpoints are defined inside the `_config.scss` file, and based on these breakpoints the mixins will be generated.

```scss title="_config.scss"
$RESPONSIVE_BREAKPOINTS: (
	xs: 575.98px,
	sm: 576px,
	md: 768px,
	lg: 992px,
	xl: 1200px,
	xxl: 1400px,
) !default;
```

## Responsive mixins

Here is the list of all available responsive mixins:

### Extra small

`break-xs()`

### Small

`break-sm()`  
`break-sm-min()`  
`break-sm-max()`

### Medium

`break-md()`  
`break-md-min()`  
`break-md-max()`

### Large

`break-lg()`  
`break-lg-min()`  
`break-lg-max()`

### Extra large

`break-xl()`  
`break-xl-min()`  
`break-xl-max()`

### Extra extra large

`break-xxl()`  
`break-xxl-max()`

## Use responsive mixins

The example below indicates how to use the mixins to make conditions for responsive design.

```scss title="custom-style.scss"
body {
	padding: 50px;

	@include break-sm {
		padding: 10px;
	}
}
```

What will be compiled is:

```css title="custom-style.css"
body {
	padding: 50px;
}

/* Small breakpoint */
@media screen and (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767px) {
	body {
		padding: 10px;
	}
}
```
