title: Night mode
sidebar_position: 8.5

If you use Sass to develop, there is a predefined placeholder selector for night mode, this file is in `/scss/helpers/_night.scss`, in this file the `%dark-mode` selector is defined you can create your selectors by extending it.  
Here is an example of a dark mode selector:

```scss title="style.scss"
html.dark {
  @extend %dark-mode;
}
// or
html[data-theme="dark"] {
  @extend %dark-mode;
}
```

Now if the `<html>` tag has the `.dark` class or `data-theme="dark"` attribute, the dark mode will be applied.  
Note that you should extend this selector as `<html>` tag because it changes CSS variables that are defined as the `:root`.
