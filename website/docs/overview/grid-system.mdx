title: Grid system
---

FlatifyCSS does not provide a grid system, in the humble opinion of the FlatifyCSS team, **it is not necessary**, at this point in time you can create impressive layouts with the mixture of CSS [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).
Therefore there is no need to add a bunch of code that is not even flexible enough for any layout, you can make something better with the technologies mentioned above.

If you still want to use a grid system, you can add [Bootstrap grid file](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/dist/css/bootstrap-grid.min.css) to your project.
