title: Containers
---

To have a clean layout using containers to limit the width will be a practical example, there are some predefined container classes that you can use:   

`.container-sm`   
`.container-md`   
`.container-lg`   
`.container-xl`   
`.container-xxl`   

These classes are generated based on the `$RESPONSIVE_BREAKPOINTS` variable inside the `_config.scss` file:

```scss title="_config.scss"
$RESPONSIVE_BREAKPOINTS: (
  xs: 575.98px,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px,
  xxl: 1400px,
) !default;
```
